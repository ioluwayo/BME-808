# BME-808
This repository contains python code for the labs in my Computations in Genetic Engineering (BME808) course at Ryerson University.
### Lab 2 ###
### Lab 3 ###
### Lab 4 ###
Lab 4 involves the implementation of a global alignment algorithm known as the Needleman wunsch algortithm.
It uses dynamic programing to find the optimal global alignment between to DNA sequences. see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm
See the [program](https://github.com/ioluwayo/BME-808/blob/master/LAB4/needle.py) for my implementation of the algorithm which uses path finding to achive the alignement between the sequences
